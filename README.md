# Visualize Toronto's Open Data with D3.js

This is my first foray into the dark magic of D3.js. Probably one of the most verbose coding experiences just to visualize something as (seemingly) simple as a pie chart... I guess that's javascript for you.

On a real note, this is just a taste of the power behind D3 and I will use this little project as a way to develop my visualization skills.  The final product should be a dashboard that brings to life whatever data the City of Toronto uploads.

### Running the Viz:

`python -m http.server` 

This will start a local server on port 8000 which is necessary since the data is being loaded asynchronously.
